# Chess Engine in Python

This is a custom-built chess engine implemented in Python using the `python-chess` library. It supports basic features such as random move generation, material and positional evaluation, Minimax algorithm, Alpha-Beta pruning, and iterative deepening search.

üß† Algorithms
Minimax: Recursive brute-force game tree exploration.

Alpha-Beta Pruning: Cuts off unnecessary branches to improve efficiency.

Iterative Deepening: Performs repeated deepening of search to improve move ordering and pruning.
